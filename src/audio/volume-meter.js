Usage:
audioNode = createAudioMeter(audioContext,clipLevel,averaging,clipLag);

audioContext: the AudioContext you're using.
clipLevel: the level (0 to 1) that you would consider "clipping".
   Defaults to 0.98.
averaging: how "smoothed" you would like the meter to be over time.
   Should be between 0 and less than 1.  Defaults to 0.95.
clipLag: how long you would like the "clipping" indicator to show
   after clipping has occured, in milliseconds.  Defaults to 750ms.

Access the clipping through node.checkClipping(); use node.shutdown to get rid of it.
